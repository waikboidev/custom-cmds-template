# ü§ñ Custom Command Discord Bot Template

A powerful and flexible Discord bot template that allows you to create complex custom commands using a simple, JSON-based action system. This template is designed for easy expansion, allowing you to add new actions and functionality with minimal effort.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Command Creation:** Create and delete commands on-the-fly without restarting the bot.
- **Action-Based System:** Chain together a series of actions to create complex command logic.
- **Highly Expandable:** Easily add new, custom actions to extend the bot's capabilities.
- **Simple Configuration:** Uses a `.env` file for easy setup of your bot's token and prefix.
- **Interactive Components:** Built-in support for buttons and select menus.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure your bot:**
    - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
    - Open the `.env` file and add your Discord bot token and desired prefix.
    ```
    TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
    PREFIX=$
    ```
4.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Custom Commands

You can create custom commands directly within Discord using the `$createcmd` and `$deletecmd` commands.

### `$createcmd <command_name> <json_logic>`

This command creates a new custom command. The `json_logic` is an array of action objects.

**Example:**

```
$createcmd hello [{"reply": "Hello, {user.username}!"}, {"wait": 2000}, {"editMessage": {"message_id": "last", "content": "Hope you are having a great day!"}}]
```

This creates a command named `hello` that replies with a greeting, waits 2 seconds, and then edits the message.

### `$deletecmd <command_name>`

This command deletes an existing custom command.

**Example:**

```
$deletecmd hello
```

## üîß Expandability and Modification

This bot is designed to be easily expanded. You can add your own custom actions by following these steps:

1.  **Create a new file** in the `Actions` directory (e.g., `myNewAction.js`).
2.  **Structure your action** file like this:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        name: 'myNewAction',
        async execute({ params, context, messageOrInteraction }) {
            // Your action logic here
        },
    };
    ```

3.  **The bot will automatically load** your new action on startup. You can then use it in your custom commands.
